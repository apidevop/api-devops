## Documentation

An API needs a proper documentation to help developers to use the API.

It is important to have a short but meaningful description about the purpose of the API.

Describe important use cases to give developers a quick headstart.

The goal is to enable a developer to use your API as quickly as possible:

- Enable a developer to use your API in 5 minutes
- Documentation is non-negotiable!

Use **Swagger** as description and definition language of your API.

Use **Swagger** to create API reference documentation.

We **strongly** advise against generating a API description from code. The only proper place for generating Swagger from code is for automated validation to validate that a API signature has not changed from one release to the next. See also [Generating Swagger from Code](http://dev.org-lexware.com/generate-swagger/) for some practical advice.

Use an API Management Portal to allow developers to get familar and to test your API.
