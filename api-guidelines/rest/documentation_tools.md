## Documentation Tools
One of the key benefits to Spec-Driven Development is that instead of
having to rely on costly and complex vendors—or trying to build an ad-hoc
API documentation solution out of a CMS like WordPress or Drupal—specs
like RAML, Swagger and API Blueprint have strong open source
communities surrounding them that offer prebuilt documentation tools you
can use.


## Choosing a Spec
Choosing the best specification for your company’s needs will make
building, maintaining, documenting and sharing your API easier. Because
Spec-Driven Development encourages the use of a well tested,
standardized spec, it is highly recommended that you choose from RAML,
Swagger or API Blueprint. However, each of these specs brings along with
it unique strengths and weaknesses, so it is important to understand what
your needs are, as well as which specification best meets those needs.


## Swagger
The oldest and most mature of the specs, Swagger, just recently released
Version 2.0, a version that changes from JSON to the YAML format for
editing and provides more intuitive tooling such as an API Designer and an
API Console. Swagger brings with it the largest community and has
recently been acquired by SmartBear, while also being backed by Apigee
and 3Scale. However, with the transition from JSON to YAML, you may find
yourself having to maintain two different specs to keep documentation and
scripts up to date. Swagger also lacks strong support for design patterns
and code reusability—important aspects of Spec-Driven Development



## API Blueprint
Created by Apiary in March of 2013, API Blueprint is designed to help you
build and document your API. However, API Blueprint lacks the tooling and
language support of RAML and Swagger, and utilizes a specialized
markdown format for documenting, making it more difficult to use in the
long run. Just the same, API Blueprint has a strong community and does
excel with its documentation generator.


## RAML
The baby of the three most popular specs, RAML 0.8, was released in
October 2013. This spec was quickly backed by a strong working group
consisting of members from MuleSoft, PayPal, Intuit, Airware, Akana
(formally SOA Software), Cisco and more. What makes RAML truly unique
is that it was developed to model an API, not just document it. It also
comes with powerful tools including a RAML/ API Designer, an API Console
and the API Notebook—a unique tool that lets developers interact with your
API. RAML is also written in the YAML format, making it easy to read, and
easy to edit—regardless of one’s technical background.
